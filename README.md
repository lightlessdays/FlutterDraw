## Getting Started âœ…

Before getting started, make sure you have a version of Node.JS greater than 18.17 installed in your system. You can install Node.JS by [clicking here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You can learn about Node.JS from [here](https://blog.dhruvbadaya.in/what-the-fck-is-nodejs-a-complete-tutorial).

To get started, follow the given steps:

- **Step 1:** Download the code for the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/lightlessdays/FlutterDraw/archive/refs/tags/v1.zip).
- **Step 2:** Unzip the downloaded folder and open the folder in Visual Studio Code (or your favorite terminal).
- **Step 3:** Get your OPENAI GPT-4 Access Key and copy the following command:
  ```
  echo OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key > .env.local
  ```
  Make sure to replace sk-your-key with your OPENAI key.
  This will create a new file called `$.env.local` in your folder.
- Once the command runs, enter the following command:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  This command will install all the required NPM Packages for FlutterDraw.
- Lastly, run the following command:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start the FlutterDraw server. Once the server starts, go to your favorite browser and type in the URL `https://localhost:3000` or [click here](https://localhost:3000). This will take you to the FlutterDraw whiteboard, where you can start drawing.

## Inspiration ðŸ˜Ž

This project has been inspired from, and several components of the code and UI have been derived from the original project by Sawyer Hood that translated wireframes into HTML & CSS. If you want to convert your drawings into HTML & CSS, instead of Flutter, check out this repository: [https://github.com/SawyerHood/draw-a-ui](https://github.com/SawyerHood/draw-a-ui)https://github.com/SawyerHood/draw-a-ui
